**RE: Requesting Cooperation on Combined Project**

Dear Ammar,

Thank you for considering me for this collaborative project. I’m excited to work with you in this UI-UX project.

The project scope and objectives you outlined are clear and I want to share a few suggestions for our next steps.

- To ensure our design meets user needs, we could start by conducting user research.
- Conducting usability tests with a small group of users
- It’s important to maintain a consistent color pallette for visual consistency throughout the project.
Please let me know if there are any specific areas or tasks you’d like me to prioritize.

Best regards,
